                    <h2>Clinical Background</h2>
                    <p>Jane Wentzien is a senior physical therapist with over three decades of hands-on clinical experience spanning acute care, outpatient rehabilitation, and long-term recovery management.</p>
                    
                    <p>Her career has been defined by a commitment to understanding not just the protocols, but the human realities of recovery—the psychological barriers, the lifestyle constraints, and the individual variations that determine whether a treatment plan succeeds or fails in the real world.</p>
                    
                    <p>For the past decade, Jane has led rehabilitation teams, training clinicians to recognize the subtle signs that standardized approaches miss. This experience revealed a critical gap: as healthcare scales through technology, the nuanced clinical judgment that prevents failures often gets lost.</p>
                    
                    <p>Today, Jane applies this senior clinical perspective to help organizations and individuals avoid the blind spots that undermine rehabilitation outcomes at scale.</p>

            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Recovery is not linear, and people are not protocols. Every successful rehabilitation program must account for the unpredictable nature of human healing—pain responses vary, motivation fluctuates, and life circumstances intervene.</p>
            
            <p>Jane's approach centers on identifying where assumptions break down. Whether reviewing a digital health platform serving thousands or creating a personalized plan for an individual, the goal is the same: anticipate the failure points before they become failures.</p>
            
            <p>This is not about validating outcomes or certifying quality. It's about applying decades of clinical judgment to surface the risks that data alone cannot reveal.</p>
